# MQ3 - Alcohol Click (Mikroe) #

## Summary ##

This example project shows an example for Mikroe Alcohol Click board driver integration with Silicon Labs Platform.

Alcohol Click is based on the MQ-3 sensor, which detects the presence and the concentration of alcohol in the air. It has a high sensitivity to alcohol and slight to benzine, suitable for detecting alcohol in concentrations from 0.04 to 4mg/l.

The MQ-3 provides an analog representation of its concentration in the air sent directly to an analog pin of the mikroBUS™ socket labeled OUT. The analog output voltage provided by the sensor varies in proportion to the alcohol concentration; the higher the alcohol concentration in the air, the higher the output voltage. Also, this Click board™ has a built-in potentiometer that allows users to adjust the Load Resistance of the MQ-3 circuit for optimum performance

## Required Hardware ##

- 1x [XG24-EK2703A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg24-explorer-kit) EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit

- Or 1x [Wi-Fi Development Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi) based on SiWG917 (e.g. [SIWX917-DK2605A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-dk2605a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-dev-kit) or [SIWX917-RB4338A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-rb4338a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board))

- 1x [Alcohol Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/alcohol-click) based on MQ-3 sensor

## Hardware Connection ##

- If the EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit is used:

  The Alcohol Click board supports MikroBus, so it can connect easily to the Explorer Kit via MikroBus header. Assure that the 45-degree corner of Click board matches the 45-degree white line of the Explorer Kit.

  The hardware connection is shown in the image below:

- If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:

  | Description  | BRD4338A + BRD4002A | BRD2605A    | Acohol Click  |
  | ----------------------| -----------| ------------| ------------- |
  | Positive analog input | ULP_GPIO_1 [P16] | ULP_GPIO_1 | OUT      |

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by **mq3**.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - MQ3 - Alcohol Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_alcohol_mq3/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting existing file).

3. Install the software components:

    - Open the .slcp file in the project.

    - Select the SOFTWARE COMPONENTS tab.

    - Install the following components:

      **If the EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit is used:**

        - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
        - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: **vcom**
        - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
        - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [MQ3 - Alcohol Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration

      **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**

        - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
        - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [ADC] → [channel_1] → use default configuration
        - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [MQ3 - Alcohol Click (Mikroe)]

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash this example to the board.

**Note :**

- Make sure that the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension is installed. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).

- **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install "MQ3 - Alcohol Click (Mikroe)" component.

## How It Works ##

### Driver Layer Diagram ###

### Testing ###

The example detects the presence and concentration of alcohol in the air and shows a message on the log screen, which is raw data and the output voltage of ADC.

You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like TeraTerm to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output is shown in the figure below.

## Report Bugs & Get Support ##

To report bugs in the Application Examples projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo. Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo.
