# LCA717 - Relay 2 Click (Mikroe) #

## Summary ##

This project shows the implementation of a two single-pole solid state relays (SSR) IC that is integrated on the Relay 2 Click board.

Relay 2 click is a dual relay click board™, equipped with two single-pole solid state relays (SSR), built with the patented OptoMOS® technology. These SSR devices allow reasonably high current, up to 2A and voltage up to 30V (peak-to-peak). It can be used as an MCU controlled switch for the instrumentation and sensor circuitry power control, various I/O subsystems, control of various embedded electronic applications, and similar cases where reliable and clean power supply control is required.

## Required Hardware ##

- 1x [BGM220-EK4314A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth/bgm220-explorer-kit) BGM220 Bluetooth Module Explorer Kit

- Or 1x [Wi-Fi Development Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi) based on SiWG917 (e.g. [SIWX917-DK2605A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-dk2605a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-dev-kit) or [SIWX917-RB4338A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-rb4338a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board))

- 1x [Relay 2 Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/relay-2-click)

## Hardware Connection ##

- If the BGM220P Explorer Kit is used:

  The Relay 2 Click board supports MikroBus, so it can connect easily to the Explorer Kit via MikroBus header. Assure that the 45-degree corner of Click board matches the 45-degree white line of the Explorer Kit.

- If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:

  | Description  | BRD4338A + BRD4002A | BRD2605A     | MikroE Relay 2 Click board |
  | -------------| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
  | Relay 1      | GPIO_46 [P24]       | GPIO_10      | RL1                          |
  | Relay 2      | GPIO_47 [P26]       | GPIO_11      | RL2                          |

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by **"relay"**.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - LCA717 - Relay 2 Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_relay2_lca717/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Install the software components:

    - Open the .slcp file in the project.

    - Select the SOFTWARE COMPONENTS tab.

    - Install the following components:

      **If the BGM220P Explorer Kit is used:**

        - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
        - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Miscellaneous] → [LCA717 - Relay 2 Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration.

           ![config](image/configuration.png)

      **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**

        - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
        - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Miscellaneous] → [LCA717 - Relay 2 Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration.

           ![config](image/configuration_si91x.png)

4. Build and flash this example to the board.

**Note:**

- Make sure that the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension is installed. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).

- **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install "LCA717 - Relay 2 Click (Mikroe)" component.

## How It Works ##

The input stage of the device is comprised of a highly efficient GaAIAs infrared LED, used to drive the photovoltaic elements of the SSR. The output stage has two N-type MOSFETs, which allow both DC and AC to be switched to the output stage.

## Report Bugs & Get Support ##

To report bugs in the Application Examples projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [platform_hardware_drivers_sdk_extensions](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/platform_hardware_drivers_sdk_extensions) repo. Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [platform_hardware_drivers_sdk_extensions](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/platform_hardware_drivers_sdk_extensions) repo.
