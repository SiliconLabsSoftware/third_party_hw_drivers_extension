# AS7265x - Sparkfun Triad Spectroscopy Sensor #

## Summary ##

This project shows the implementation of the Triad Spectroscopy Sensor using a **Triad Spectroscopy Sensor-AS7265x** with Silicon Labs platform based on I2C communication.

The SparkFun Triad Spectroscopy Sensor is a powerful optical inspection sensor also known as a spectrophotometer. Three AS7265x spectral sensors are combined alongside visible, UV, and IR LEDs to illuminate and test various surfaces for light spectroscopy. The Triad is made up of three sensors; the AS72651, the AS72652, and the AS72653 and can detect light from 410nm (UV) to 940nm (IR).

For more information about the Triad Spectroscopy Sensor-AS7265x, see the [specification page](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/c/2/9/0/a/AS7265x_Datasheet.pdf).

## Hardware Connection ##

A Triad Spectroscopy Sensor - AS7265x can be easily connected with two I2C wires (SDA and SCL) along with 3v3 and GND. For the designated boards, SparkFun qwiic compatible STEMMA QT connectors can be used.

- **If the BGM220P Explorer Kit is used**:

  The connection is shown in the image below:

- **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used**:

  The hardware connection is shown in the table below:

  | Description  | BRD4338A + BRD4002A | BRD2605A | Triad Spectroscopy Sensor  |
  | -------------| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
  | I2C_SDA      | ULP_GPIO_6 [EXP_16] | Qwiic cable  | SDA                |
  | I2C_SCL      | ULP_GPIO_7 [EXP_15] | Qwiic cable  | SCL                |

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your board to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by "as7265x".

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - AS7265X - Triad Spectroscopy Sensor (SparkFun)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/sparkfun_spectroscopy_as7265x/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Install the software components:

   - Open the .slcp file in the project.
   - Select the SOFTWARE COMPONENTS tab.
   - Install the following components:

      - **If the BGM220P Explorer Kit is used:**

         - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
         - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
         - [Application] → [Utility] → [Assert]
         - [Platform] → [Driver] → [I2C] → [I2CSPM] → default instance name: qwiic
         - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [AS7265x - Triad Spectroscopy Sensor (Sparkfun) - I2C]

      - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**

         - [Application] → [Utility] → [Assert]
         - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [I2C] → [i2c2]
         - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [AS7265x - Triad Spectroscopy Sensor (Sparkfun) - I2C]

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash the project to your device.

## How It Works ##

### API Overview ###

`sparkfun_as7265x.c`: implements APIs for application.

- Initialization and configuration API: specific register read/write to get and set settings for AS7265X.

- Read Sensor Data/Status: specific register read to get acceleration data and status.

- Low-level functions: initialize I2C communication, read/write a memory block via I2C, given memory address, and read/write a register via I2C, given register address.

### Testing ###

This simple test application demonstrates some of the available features of the A Triad Spectroscopy Sensor - AS7265x, after initialization, the Triad Spectroscopy Sensor - AS7265x measures the value and return on the serial communication interface.

You can choose which type of test you want by uncommenting the #define, follow the below steps to test the example:

1. Open a terminal program on your PC, such as the Console that is integrated into Simplicity Studio or a third-party tool terminal like TeraTerm to receive the logs from the virtual COM port.

2. Depending on the test mode defined in the `app.c` file, the code application can operate in different modes.

- If you use **TEST_BASIC_READING** for testing, this example takes all 18 readings, 372nm to 966nm, over I2C and outputs them to the serial port.

   ![basic reading](image/basic_reading.png "Basic Reading Result")

- If you use **TEST_BASIC_READING_WITH_LED** for testing, this example takes all 18 readings and blinks the illumination LEDs as it goes, resets the device, and observes the log messages.

- If you use **TEST_READ_RAW_VALUE** for testing, this example shows how to output the raw sensor values.

- If you use **TEST_MAX_READ_RATE** for testing, this example shows how to set up the sensor for max, calibrated read rate.
