# Water Detect Click (Mikroe) #

## Summary ##

This example project shows an example for Mikroe Water Detect Click board driver integration.

Water Detect click is used for detecting water and other electroconductive liquids. If the detection area is wet the output of Microchip's MCP606 CMOS op-amp will go positive, signaling the presence of liquid.

This device can be used as a household flood alarm sensor, or rain detector for smart buildings. It is also usable for water tanks where it acts as a limit switch of pumping.

## Required Hardware ##

- 1x [XG24-EK2703A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg24-explorer-kit) EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit

- Or 1x [Wi-Fi Development Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi) based on SiWG917 (e.g. [SIWX917-DK2605A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-dk2605a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-dev-kit) or [SIWX917-RB4338A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-rb4338a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board))

- 1x [Water Detect Click](https://www.mikroe.com/water-detect-click)

## Hardware Connection ##

- If the EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit is used:

  The Water Detect Click board supports MikroBus, so it can connect easily to the Explorer Kit via MikroBus header. Assure that the 45-degree corner of Click board matches the 45-degree white line of the Explorer Kit.

  The hardware connection is shown in the image below:

- If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:

  | Description  | BRD4338A + BRD4002A | BRD2605A  | Water Detector Click |
  | -------------| --------------------| ----------| -------------------- |
  | GPIO         | GPIO_46 [P24]       | GPIO_10   | INT                  |

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by *water*

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - Water Detect Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_water_detect/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Install the software components:

    - Open the .slcp file in the project.

    - Select the SOFTWARE COMPONENTS tab.

    - Install the following components:

      **If the EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit is used:**

        - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
        - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
        - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
        - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [Water Detect Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration

      **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**

        - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
        - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [Water Detect Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration

4. Build and flash this example to the board.

**Note:**

- Make sure that the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension is installed. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).

- **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install "Water Detect Click (Mikroe)" component.

## How It Works ##

### Driver Layer Diagram ###

### Testing ###

You can choose the mode of operation by selecting the corresponding macro MIKROE_WATER_DETECT_MODE_INTERRUPT or MIKROE_WATER_DETECT_MODE_POLLING.

After resetting, the application reads the device status and determines if there is water presence or not.
You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like TeraTerm to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output and an actual test image are shown in the figure below.

## Report Bugs & Get Support ##

To report bugs in the Application Examples projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo. Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo.
